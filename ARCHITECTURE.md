# Rust Game Engine Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of a game engine written in Rust using the WGSL crate. The goal is to create an efficient and maintainable engine that supports rendering a small terrain with static and animated objects. This architecture emphasizes separation of concerns between asset loading, GPU data handling, object updates, animations, and rendering.

## 1. Asset Loading System

**Purpose:** Load assets (models, textures, animations) from disk into CPU memory.

**Implementation:**

- **Asset Loader Module:** Responsible for parsing asset files (e.g., OBJ, GLTF) and converting them into a structured format.
- **Data Structures:** Define data structures to represent models, meshes, materials, and animations.

```rust
struct Model {
    meshes: Vec<Mesh>,
    materials: Vec<Material>,
    animations: Vec<Animation>,
}

struct Mesh {
    vertices: Vec<Vertex>,
    indices: Vec<u32>,
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Use asynchronous IO to load assets without blocking the main thread.
- Implement caching to avoid reloading assets unnecessarily.

## 2. GPU Resource Management

**Purpose:** Transfer asset data from CPU memory to GPU memory.

**Implementation:**

- **Resource Manager Module:** Handles creation and management of GPU resources like buffers and textures.
- **Buffer Creation:** Use WGSL to create buffers for vertices, indices, and uniform data.

```rust
struct GPUResourceManager {
    vertex_buffers: HashMap<Handle<Mesh>, wgpu::Buffer>,
    index_buffers: HashMap<Handle<Mesh>, wgpu::Buffer>,
}

impl GPUResourceManager {
    fn upload_mesh(&mut self, mesh: &Mesh) {
        // Create vertex and index buffers and store them in the hashmap
    }
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Batch uploads to minimize GPU overhead.
- Track resource lifetimes to manage GPU memory effectively.

## 3. Scene Graph

**Purpose:** Represent the hierarchical relationship of objects in the scene.

**Implementation:**

- **Scene Node Structure:** Each node represents an object in the scene, with properties like transformation, animation state, and optional mesh data. The scene graph is represented as a tree where each node can have multiple children, allowing for hierarchical transformations (e.g., a car model with wheels as child nodes).

```rust
struct SceneNode {
    children: Vec<SceneNode>,
    transformation: Matrix4,
    animation_state: Option<AnimationState>,
    mesh_handle: Option<Handle<Mesh>>,
}

struct Scene {
    root: SceneNode,
}
```

- **Node Transformations:** Each node stores a local transformation, which can include translation, rotation, and scaling. The final world transformation of a node is computed by combining its local transformation with that of its parent.

- **Example:** If a child node represents an object attached to a moving parent (e.g., a wheel attached to a car), the child’s transformation will be relative to the parent’s transformation.

- **Traversal:** The scene graph is traversed to compute world transformations for each node and to perform rendering. This traversal is usually done recursively.

```rust
impl Scene {
    fn traverse<F>(&self, node: &SceneNode, parent_transform: &Matrix4, callback: &mut F)
    where
        F: FnMut(&SceneNode, &Matrix4),
    {
        let world_transform = parent_transform * node.transformation;
        callback(node, &world_transform);
        for child in &node.children {
            self.traverse(child, &world_transform, callback);
        }
    }
}
```

**Considerations:**

- **Hierarchical Transformations:** The scene graph naturally supports hierarchical relationships, making it easier to animate and manage complex structures like articulated models (e.g., robots, vehicles).
- **Instancing Support:** Nodes can reference the same mesh data to support instancing, which reduces memory usage and improves rendering efficiency for repeated objects (e.g., trees or rocks).
- **Culling Optimization:** During traversal, culling techniques such as frustum culling can be applied to avoid processing nodes that are outside the camera's view, improving performance.
- **Level of Detail (LOD):** The scene graph can also be extended to handle different levels of detail for nodes, allowing distant objects to be rendered with fewer details.

## 4. Animation System

**Purpose:** Update the transformation of nodes based on their animation state.

**Implementation:**

- **Animation State:** Store current time/frame and interpolation data.
- **Animation Update Function:** Update transformations each frame.

```rust
struct AnimationState {
    current_time: f32,
    playback_speed: f32,
    keyframes: Vec<Keyframe>,
}

impl AnimationState {
    fn update(&mut self, delta_time: f32) {
        self.current_time += delta_time * self.playback_speed;
        // Interpolate between keyframes
    }
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Support pause, play, and rewind functionalities.
- Handle looping and non-looping animations.

## 5. Update Loop

**Purpose:** Update the state of the game world each frame.

**Implementation:**

- **Game Loop:** Separate update and render phases.
- **Update Phase:** Handle input, update animations, physics, and AI.

```rust
fn update(delta_time: f32, scene: &mut Scene) {
    // Traverse the scene graph and update each node
    fn update_node(node: &mut SceneNode, delta_time: f32) {
        if let Some(animation_state) = &mut node.animation_state {
            animation_state.update(delta_time);
            node.transformation = animation_state.get_current_transformation();
        }
        for child in &mut node.children {
            update_node(child, delta_time);
        }
    }

    update_node(&mut scene.root, delta_time);
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Decouple the update rate from the render rate if necessary.
- Ensure thread safety if using multi-threading.

## 6. Render System

**Purpose:** Draw the scene to the screen.

**Implementation:**

- **MeshRenderer** and **Mesh List:** The rendering process is driven by a `MeshRenderer` that takes a `MeshList` containing items that need to be rendered. Each item in the `MeshList` consists of a transformation matrix (`mat4` from the `glam` crate) and a handle to the corresponding mesh.

```rust
struct MeshItem {
    transform: glam::Mat4,
    mesh_handle: Handle<Mesh>,
}

struct MeshList {
    items: Vec<MeshItem>,
}

struct MeshRenderer;

impl MeshRenderer {
    fn render(&self, mesh_list: &MeshList, gpu_manager: &GPUResourceManager, encoder: &mut wgpu::CommandEncoder) {
        let mut grouped_items: HashMap<Handle<Mesh>, Vec<glam::Mat4>> = HashMap::new();
        for item in &mesh_list.items {
            grouped_items
                .entry(item.mesh_handle)
                .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
                .push(item.transform);
        }

        for (mesh_handle, transforms) in grouped_items {
            if let Some(vertex_buffer) = gpu_manager.vertex_buffers.get(&mesh_handle) {
                // Upload instance transformation matrices to GPU
                let instance_buffer = create_instance_buffer(&transforms, encoder);
                // Bind buffers and set up uniforms for the transformation matrix
                // Issue draw call for each instance
            }
        }
    }
}

fn create_instance_buffer(transforms: &[glam::Mat4], encoder: &mut wgpu::CommandEncoder) -> wgpu::Buffer {
    // Create a buffer with instance transformation data and upload to GPU
    // Implementation goes here
    unimplemented!()
}

```

- **Collecting Meshes for Rendering:** During the render phase, traverse the scene graph to collect all meshes to be rendered into a `MeshList`. This list is then passed to the `MeshRenderer`.

```rust
fn collect_meshes(scene: &Scene, parent_transform: &Matrix4, mesh_list: &mut MeshList) {
    scene.traverse(&scene.root, parent_transform, &mut |node, world_transform| {
        if let Some(mesh_handle) = node.mesh_handle {
            mesh_list.items.push(MeshItem {
                transform: *world_transform,
                mesh_handle,
            });
        }
    });
}
```

- **Render Pass:** Set up the rendering pipeline using WGSL shaders and draw all meshes in the `MeshList`.

```rust
fn render(scene: &Scene, gpu_manager: &GPUResourceManager, encoder: &mut wgpu::CommandEncoder) {
    let mut mesh_list = MeshList { items: Vec::new() };
    collect_meshes(scene, &Matrix4::identity(), &mut mesh_list);
    let mesh_renderer = MeshRenderer;
    mesh_renderer.render(&mesh_list, gpu_manager, encoder);
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Use frustum culling to optimize rendering.
- Support different render queues for opaque and transparent objects.

## 7. Main Loop

**Purpose:** Orchestrate the update and render phases in a continuous loop.

**Implementation:**

- **Event Loop:** Use Rust's event loop (e.g., from `winit` crate) to handle window events.
- **Loop Structure:**

```rust
loop {
    // Handle events
    let delta_time = compute_delta_time();
    update(delta_time, &mut scene);
    render(&scene, &gpu_manager, &mut encoder);
    // Submit commands to the GPU
}
```

**Considerations:**

- Maintain a consistent frame rate using timing mechanisms.
- Handle window resizing and input events appropriately.

## 8. Separation of Concerns

- **Loading Assets from Disk:** All disk IO operations are confined to the Asset Loading System. Assets are loaded once at startup or during level transitions.
- **Sending Data to the GPU:** The GPU Resource Manager handles all GPU interactions, and assets are uploaded to the GPU after loading.
- **Updating Objects and Animations:** The Update Loop and Animation System manage object states independently.
- **Rendering the Scene:** The Render System is responsible for drawing, with no game state modifications during this phase.

## 9. Additional Tips

- **Modularity:** Keep each system in its own module or crate for clarity.
- **Data-Oriented Design:** Consider using ECS (Entity-Component-System) for better data locality.
- **Profiling:** Regularly profile your engine to identify and fix bottlenecks.
- **Documentation:** Document each module and function for easier maintenance.

By following this architecture, you can achieve a clean separation of concerns, making the game engine maintainable and scalable. Each system handles a specific aspect of the engine, interacting through well-defined interfaces.
